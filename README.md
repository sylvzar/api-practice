# MediaDB - Website searching OMDb API database
Live demo: https://tender-ramanujan-5da001.netlify.app/

This is a fun project I really wanted to make to practice react hooks a little bit more.

# Functionality

This website features a search function that fetches data from OMDb API and displays search results. After selecting a film we would like to know more about, the webiste fetches additional data and renders another component with more information about a specific production.
